# Social Media Application - Backend

## Overview

This is the backend for the Social Media Application built using **Node.js** and **Express**. The backend handles user authentication, posts management, friend connections, and real-time interactions (such as messaging). It communicates with a database to store and retrieve user data, posts, and other social-related content.

The backend API is designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to integrate with a front-end interface (React in this case).

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and JWT-based authentication for users.
- **User Profiles**: Allows users to manage their profiles, including updating their information, profile pictures, and bio.
- **Friend Management**: Add and remove friends, as well as view lists of friends and friend suggestions.
- **Post Management**: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for posts and the ability to like, comment, and share posts.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to **MongoDB** for data storage and retrieval.
- **Secure API**: Input validation, request sanitization, and error handling to ensure a secure API.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL for data storage.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication..
- **Mongoose** (If using MongoDB): ORM to interact with the MongoDB database.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 
- **MongoDB** 
- **Postman** (or similar API testing tool)
